            I am Prince Kumar, a B.Tech student with a burning passion for <span class="about-highlight">cybersecurity</span> and <span class="about-highlight">digital forensics</span>. My journey into the world of security began with curiosity about how systems work and how they can be broken and defended. Today I operate confidently on both sides of the security spectrum.

          <p id="about-paragraph-2" class="about-paragraph">
            As a <span class="about-highlight">Red Teamer</span>, I simulate real-world attacks, conduct <span class="about-highlight">penetration testing</span>, and develop social engineering tools to expose vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. As a <span class="about-highlight">Blue Teamer</span>, I focus on threat hunting, incident response, and forensic investigation to protect and analyze digital environments.
          </p>
          <p id="about-paragraph-3" class="about-paragraph">
            I actively participate in <span class="about-highlight">CTF competitions</span> on platforms like TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and PortSwigger, constantly sharpening my skills against real-world challenges. I also engage in bug hunting, searching for vulnerabilities in live applications to contribute to a safer internet.
          </p>
          <p id="about-paragraph-4" class="about-paragraph">
            Beyond technical skills, I have experience in <span class="about-highlight">prompt engineering</span>, which enables me to effectively leverage AI-driven tools and systems. I believe in continuous learning and my portfolio reflects a commitment to mastering both the art of attack and the science of defense.
